# IOT-Based-Home-Automation
Developed an IoT-based home automation system using the Arduino IDE and Blynk IoT app, enabling remote control of garden lights, temperature regulation, and water tank management through real-time monitoring and automation. The system was simulated in PICSimLab to validate its functionality and integrated with sensors like LDR and LM35 for precise environmental data collection. Serial communication was implemented to ensure efficient control of water levels and temperature, prioritizing system reliability and user convenience for an enhanced automation experience.
